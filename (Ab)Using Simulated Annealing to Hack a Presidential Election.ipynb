    "The year is 2016. You, as a young and vibrant presidential election candidate in May of the coming election in November sit with your election team in a meeting to decide where to spend the next 5 months of your campaign. In reality, you could visit everywhere at least once, but your intuition says there may be a better way to garnish just enough support to win, you your team comes up with an idea: to only visit states that have the least population. Because of the design of the electoral college, this is completely a useful strategy. You don't need all of the public vote to win, just enough states with enough electoral college votes. Picking states with the fewest amount of people that allows you to win gives you a massive advantage, since you don't have to knock on a lot of doors, kiss as many babies, and most importantly, spend lot's of money to win in your campaign. Granted, your opponent may focus on battleground states, but appealing to states with the fewest amount of people is cheap, and of course you care about campaign spending, you're all about the money. In reality, So how do you choose the best combination of states with the least population to actually visit? \n",

    "In a recent post by [Geoffrey De Smet titled, 'How to become US president with less than a quarter of the votes'](https://www.optaplanner.org/blog/2016/12/06/HowToBecomeUSPresidentWithLessThanAQuarterOfTheVotes.html), Optaplanner is used to find a combination of states that allows for an election win, with the least amount of states. In his post, he mentions using two optimization algorithms in series to obtain a combination of winning states that is optimal at 21.73%. This notebook shows how to use a specific optimization meta-algorithm, simulated annealing, to produce an outcome that's close to optimal, with only a small amount of code and programmer training. Simulated annealing is an attractive tool for optimization problems because of it's simplicity and ease of simulation. It's also attractive for it's ability to handle non-linear constraints, which is a requirement for many classic constraint algorithms. If you can code a for loop, and come up with a logical error function, which may even be non-linear, you can optimize!"
